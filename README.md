# Description
**Card Jumble Combat** is a game that combines a card game with a fighting game.

Here, your objective is to fight and knock out your opponent. In order to do this, youâ€™ll need to play your cards so your fighter will execute powerful combos to do damage or maybe you will need to discard some of them to do a guard and block possible incoming damage.

Below you will find instructions for playing the game. Before that, weâ€™ll like to say that the game **MUST BE PLAYED IN 1080 RESOLUTION** because we messed up the canvas so this is the only way to show properly the cardsâ€¦

Thank you for giving a look to our game. We hope this game will make you smile and have fun, as much as we had while doing it. ðŸ˜„
